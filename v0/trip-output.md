# From Canals to Coasts: A July in Paris, Fontainebleau, Cannes, and the Riviera

## Summary

The trip unfolded as a painterly arc from the sunlit arteries of Paris to the glittering shores of the Riviera. Starts along the Canal Saint-Martin and under the glow of the Louvre, where glass pyramids and vaulted interiors drew lines of light and visitors into a living museum of architecture. A day trip to Fontainebleau offered a quieter counterpoint with formal gardens and timeless statues, while a hillside town revealed terracotta roofs and sunlit balconies perched above rolling terrain. The journey then moved to Cannes, where luxury yachts and bustling Marché Forville painted a different Riviera palette, before a late-afternoon sail along open Mediterranean waters and a final day in Nice, where pastel hills, central plazas, and Mediterranean air wrapped up the voyage. Across these days, light, water, and city textures stitched together a narrative of urban charm, coastal beauty, and intimate encounters with markets, markets, and markets of color and sound.
